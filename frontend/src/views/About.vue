        <p class="mb-4">
          Stride by Marlow was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate sneaker enthusiasts who believed that
          everyone deserves to walk in comfort and style. Our journey began in a small workshop in Nairobi, where
          we crafted our first pair of sneakers with meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to quality.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Today, we've grown into a beloved brand, known for our innovative designs and dedication to customer
          satisfaction. We continue to push the boundaries of sneaker technology while staying true to our roots
          of craftsmanship and style.
